Optistatus
==========

What is it for?

Optistatus is a little applet for the taskbar
that shows if the NVIDIA-Optimus-Card is running.

Does it work with primusrun?

Yes, because it checks the status of /proc/acpi/bbswitch, which
shows if the cards is on or not,regardless if you use
optirun or primusrun for launching your app

Bugs

There shouldn't be any...at least i hope so.
